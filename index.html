	<h2>Bard of Bengal</h2>
	<p>
            <b>Rabindranath Tagore </b> 7 May 1861  – 7 August 1941
	   was an Indian poet, writer, composer, philosopher, social reformer, and painter. He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art, with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

He became the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his collection of poems, Gitanjali. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his elegant prose and magical poetry remain largely unknown outside Bengal.

Tagore was a polymath who wrote novels, short stories, essays, and plays. He also composed over 2,000 songs, now known as Rabindra Sangeet. He founded Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan, emphasizing education rooted in culture and nature.

He also composed the national anthems of India (Jana Gana Mana) and Bangladesh (Amar Shonar Bangla), making him unique in world history.
